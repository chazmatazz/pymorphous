python run_tests.py

triple_consensus_single_line.py does not work because of limitations in 

--- Roadmap ---

# pymorphous/draw.py: simulator
## slow - the pyopengl calls are slow
## ugly - no reason to draw those rects, I just had the code handy.
## needs user input to set sense

# pymorphous/__init__.py: inspect.stack is slow.

# examples/pymorphous/gradient_demo.py: doesn't seem to work. Hard to tell.
