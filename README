--- Installation ---

PyMorphous requires numpy, pygame, PyOpenGL and biopython (for KDTree).

--- Running ---

python pymorphous.py examples/pymorphous/consensus.py

or to run all tests

python run_tests.py

triple_consensus_single_line.py does not work because of limitations in the nbr function.

--- Roadmap ---

# pymorphous/draw.py: simulator
## the current implementation is designed to be fast
## make prettier
## needs user input to set sense values, move devices
## use PyQt or other high-level GUI language. Need 3D camera control, perhaps widgets. Look into 3D aerial view open-source software, etc.

# pymorphous/__init__.py: sys._frame is fast, but perhaps unsafe? Inspect.stack is slow.

# examples/pymorphous/gradient_demo.py: doesn't seem to work. Hard to tell. Likely a bad translation of the code. Could be an issue with the field operations. They also seem very slow.

# examples/triple_consensus_single_line.py does not work because of limitations in the nbr function.

--- Profiling and Development ---

Use RunSnakeRun: http://www.vrplumber.com/programming/runsnakerun/

See also http://docs.python.org/library/profile.html for general Python profiling.

The profile is saved in PyMorphous.profile, for convenience.

View with ``runsnake PyMorphous.profile``. In RunSnake, select spawn_cloud to see the data.
