--- Installation ---

PyMorphous requires numpy, pygame, and PyOpenGL

--- Running ---

python pymorphous.py examples/pymorphous/consensus.py

or to run all tests

python run_tests.py

triple_consensus_single_line.py does not work because of limitations in the nbr function.

--- Roadmap ---

# pymorphous/draw.py: simulator
## slow - the pyopengl calls are slow
## ugly - no reason to draw those boxes, I just had the code handy.
## needs user input to set sense values, move devices

# pymorphous/__init__.py: inspect.stack is slow.

# examples/pymorphous/gradient_demo.py: doesn't seem to work. Hard to tell. Likely a bad translation of
the code.

# examples/triple_consensus_single_line.py does not work because of limitations in the nbr function.
